          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Founded in 2020 in the heart of Kuala Lumpur, our food ordering platform started 
            as a small project to help busy people enjoy their favorite meals from local 
            restaurants without the hassle. Over time, weâ€™ve grown into a trusted service 
            connecting thousands of restaurants with hungry customers across the city. 
            Our commitment is simple: tasty food, and supporting our local community.
